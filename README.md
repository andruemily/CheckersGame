# CheckersGame
Checkers game app for android

##Motivation
This app was originally made as a final project for the CSC 355 Mobile Applications class. Why remake a game that already exists though? The motivation for this project was for it to be a stepping stone in preparation of Brian's larger project of creating his own game, which was also designed to be at the core a game that moves players from one square to the next on a grid layout game board. In creating this app, both the authors got much more experience working with lots of different views and using the MVC model. 

##Authors
Emily Andrulis and Brian Hixson-Simeral made this app from the ground up.
